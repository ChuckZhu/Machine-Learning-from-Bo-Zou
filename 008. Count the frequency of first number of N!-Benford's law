'''
Benford's law, also called the first-digit law, 
is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data.

For example, 
in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the most significant digit about 30% of the time, 
while 9 appears as the most significant digit less than 5% of the time.
